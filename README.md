Useful GWT widgets and utilities contributed by [Traction Software, Inc.](http://tractionsoftware.com)

While building our new GWT-based Proteus skin for [TeamPage](http://tractionsoftware.com), we created some widgets and utilities that we thought other developers would find useful. Most of these are pretty simple, but we hope they save you some time. As we factor out code that can be shared with others, we'll add more to this project.

All of the widgets are written with minimal dependencies and can be used independently of each other.
